 Which normal form is based on 6 transitive functional dependencies and full functional
dependency? Explain the same with example. (0
 A relation R satisfies the following: FDS : A+~C , AC+D , EAD , EOH.
Find the cover for this set of FDS. (0
 Consider the universal relation: R= {A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J} and the set of functional
dependencies. F= {AB>C,A�>4DE,B>F,F>GH,D->]J}.
Determine whether each decomposition has the loss less join property with respect to F.
D; = {Ri, Ro, Rs} ;)~=~-Ri= {A, B,C, D, E} ; Ro={B,F,G,H} : R;={D,], J}.

 Write an algorithm to check whether decomposed relations are in 3NF with dependency
preservation and non � additive join property. Consider universal relation R = (U, C, L, A)
and the set of functional dependencies. F = {P � LCA, LC > AP , A > C}. Decompose
the relation R into 3NF with dependency preservation and non � additive join property.

 Consider two set of functional dependencies F = {A >C, AC>D,E�AD,E�H} and
G={A�> CD, E-> AH}. Are they equivalent? (0
