 c. Assume a disk unit has 24 ‘recording surfaces. It has a total of 14,000 cylinders. There is an
average of 400 sectors,per track. Each sector contains 512 bytes of data.
(i) | What is the maximum number of bytes that can be stored in this unit?
(ii) What is the data transfer rate in bytes per second at a rotational speed of
7200 rpm?
(iii) _Usifg a 32-bit word, suggest a suitable scheme for specifying the disk address,
“assuming that there are 512 bytes per sector.
